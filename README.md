# Journey to the Sunken City

A console-based adventure game built entirely with JavaScript.

---

## 📖 Project Description
This is a text-based adventure game designed to showcase my understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts. The game's narrative branches based on player choices, leading to multiple outcomes. It is intended to be run in a browser's developer console or a Node.js environment.

## ✨ Key Features & Learning Outcomes
* **Control Flow:** The game's story is entirely driven by `if...else` and `switch` statements, demonstrating the ability to manage complex, branching logic.
* **Data Structures & Variables:** The project uses variables and boolean flags to manage the game's state, including the player's inventory, progress, and choices.
* **Error Handling:** `try...catch` blocks are implemented to handle invalid user input gracefully, ensuring a stable and robust application.
